# A-Level Resources

### Madas Maths

[Madasmaths official site.](https://madasmaths.com/)

A collection of papers and problem sets based on the A-Level maths and further maths syllabi. The papers contained in the folder named standard are of approximate A-Level difficulty, with a few going slightly beyond. The extension papers are intended for students looking to go beyond the requirements of the A-Level, and make for an excellent bridge from A-Level to entrance exams like STEP/MAT. There are also some undergrad resources for students looking to read, though personally I haven't used these. Its almost all applied maths, and would be very well suited to someone going into an engineering/science degree looking to get ahead. 

Problem sets are all roughly A-Level with later problems requiring a higher degree of problem solving, some undergraduate sets are included. 

### STEP

### MAT

The Oxford undergraduate mathematics/computer-science and joint programmes entrance exam, read about it [here.](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test)

### TMUA

A multiple choice mathematics test used by universities such as Durham, Warwick, Imperial College London and Cambridge (for their computer science dept). Read about it [here.](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/how/maths-admission-test)
