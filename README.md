# A-Level Resources

### Madas Maths

[Madasmaths official site.](https://madasmaths.com/)

A collection of papers and problem sets based on the A-Level maths and further maths syllabi. The papers contained in the folder named standard are of approximate A-Level difficulty, with a few going slightly beyond. The extension papers are intended for students looking to go beyond the requirements of the A-Level, and make for an excellent bridge from A-Level to entrance exams like STEP/MAT. 

Problem sets are all roughly A-Level with later problems requiring a higher degree of problem solving.
